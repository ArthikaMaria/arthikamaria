## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
I am an adept Software Engineer with over two years of experience at a Fortune 500 company. I specialize in Python development, C++, sensor simulation, tool development, and visualization tools. My strong interest in Data Science and AI has led me to develop skills in machine learning, generative AI RAG frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph, and data processing tools like Pandas and Numpy. I am eager to leverage my expertise to make impactful contributions in my next role.
